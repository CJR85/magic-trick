#Create a variable called secret_num & assign to any number:
secret_num = 81
# Increase number by 1
secret_num += 1
#Take new number & double it
secret_num *= 2
# Take new number & add four to it
secret_num += 4
#Take new number & divide by two
secret_num /= 2
#Take new number & subtract your original number from it
secret_num -= 81

# Print final result
print(secret_num)
